# Keylogger
# Discription:
This is TASK-04 of PRASUNET internship 

Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

# What is Keylogger?
Keyloggers are a particularly insidious type of spyware that can record and steal consecutive keystrokes (and much more) that the user enters on a device. The term keylogger, or “keystroke logger,” is self-explanatory, Software that logs what you type on your keyboard. However, keyloggers can also enable cybercriminals to eavesdrop on you, watch you on your system camera, or listen over your smartphone’s microphone.

Since this is a spyware. I consent that I do not intend to missuse this and it is only for training and learning purpose.
I request you to not misuse this.

# How can I tell if I have a keylogger infection?
Keyloggers invade PCs (and Macs, and Androids, and iPhones) in the same way that other malware does. They install when you click on a file attachment that you’ve been duped into opening—most commonly because you fell for a social engineering scheme or a cleverly designed phishing expedition. The attachments can come to you by email, through a text message, an instant message, on social networks, or even through a visit to an otherwise legitimate but infected website, which exploits a vulnerability in it and drops a drive-by malware download. Also, keyloggers rarely arrive solo. The same Trojan that delivers the keylogger can slip other malware on your system—such as adware, spyware, ransomware, or a virus.
